# vSTUDENT - one platform for all VITians 



##### J COMP PROJECT FOR OBJECT ORIENTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (CSE4028)

Our college, VIT-Vellore closed down in March 2020, and since then, all academics operations, have been shifted online. With students studying from the comfort of their homes and joining classes over various video calling platforms which have been given the green light to be used by the college; there is still a need to improve the existing system, especially for the benefit of students.
So our project team is currently working on a Student Portal application.
